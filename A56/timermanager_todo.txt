TimerManager Improvement Notes
==============================
Date: 2026-01-27
Updated: 2026-01-27

T1. Adopt better contract documentation from A56/TimerManager.h
    - "Identity = callback pointer + token" explanation
    - "Callbacks must be plain function pointers" warning
    - "Cadence policy" explanation (nextTime += interval)
    - "Callback reentrancy is allowed" note

T4. ✅ Allow growth for infinite timers
    Removed `(repeat == 0) ? 1.0f : growth` guard
    Cap at MAX_GROWTH_INTERVAL_MS protects against runaway

T8. Document reentrancy detection checks
    Action: Add comment explaining `!active` and `cb != cb` checks
