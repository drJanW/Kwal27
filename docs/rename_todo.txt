Rename TODO (naming canon cleanup)

Navigation (workstreams):
A. Conduct → Run (DONE)
B. Intent → Request (DONE)
H. Notify → Inform/Alert/Announce (DONE: Alert)
I. Store → Catalog (CRUD) / Table (lookup) (DONE)
C. Manager → Core/Controller/Selector/Rules/etc. (non-exempt)
D. Context-as-container → Flags/Today/etc.
E. Mode → Preset/Profile (unless true FSM/progress)
F. Handle/Handler → verbNoun
G. Dispatch/Process/Orchestrator/Engine/Service/Strategy → specific verb/noun

Scope (all first-class, not optional):
- Conduct → Run
- Intent → Request
- Manager (non-exempt) → Core/Controller/Selector/Rules/etc.
- Context (as container) → Flags/Today/etc.
- Mode → Preset/Profile (unless true FSM/progress)
- Handle/Handler → verbNoun (route/update/apply/report/etc.)
- Dispatch/Process/Orchestrator/Engine/Service/Strategy → specific verb/noun
- Notify → Inform/Alert/Announce (choose per meaning; no 1:1 map)
- Store → Catalog (CRUD) / Table (lookup)

Exceptions (explicitly allowed):
- TimerManager, AudioManager
- OTA “mode” only when required by external tooling

Phase 0 — Inventory
1. Grep for all banned terms (code + docs).
2. Group by domain (audio, light, sensor, web, boot).
3. Tag each item as type/struct, function, variable, file/folder, or doc-only.

Phase 1 — Mapping
1. Define per-term replacements per domain (avoid collisions).
2. Record exceptions with rationale.
3. Decide rename order: files/folders → types → functions → variables → docs.

Phase 2 — File/Folder renames
1. Apply file/folder renames for each term family.
2. Update include paths and build config references.

Phase 3 — Type renames
1. Requests/Flags/Rules/Selector/Catalog/Table conversions.
2. Update forward declarations and includes.
3. Update all references.

Phase 4 — Function renames
1. run*/do* for execution, select* for selection.
2. Replace handle/dispatch/process/do with specific verbs.
3. Update all references.

Phase 5 — Variable renames
1. Replace container words with concrete nouns.
2. Remove “mode” unless it is real FSM/progress.

Phase 6 — Build & validate
1. Compile after each term family.
2. Verify no behavioral changes.

Phase 7 — Cleanup & lock
1. Update docs/comments to match new names.
2. Grep to confirm only approved exceptions remain.
3. Remove all legacy shim headers/cpps once references are migrated.
