Rename TODO (naming canon cleanup)

Phase 0 — Inventory
1. List candidate names that violate the naming canon.
2. Group by domain (audio, light, sensor, web, boot).
3. Note whether each item is type/struct, function, or variable.

Phase 1 — Plan
1. Map each name to its canonical replacement.
2. Check for collisions (existing names, overloads, macros).
3. Decide ordering to minimize conflicts (types before functions, headers before .cpp).

Phase 2 — Rename types
1. Update type names (Request, Flags, Rules, Selector, Catalog, Table).
2. Update forward declarations and includes.
3. Update all references.

Phase 3 — Rename functions
1. Convert execution functions to run* / do*.
2. Convert selection logic to select*.
3. Remove banned words (dispatch, intent, conduct, context as container).

Phase 4 — Rename variables
1. Replace vague container words with concrete nouns.
2. Remove “mode” unless it truly is progress/FSM.

Phase 5 — Build and validate
1. Compile and check for missing references.
2. Verify no behavioral changes.

Phase 6 — Cleanup
1. Remove stale comments or documentation references.
2. Update docs if they cite old names.
