You are working in a PlatformIO + VSCode firmware repo (Arduino/ESP32 C++). Follow this project's naming canon.

NAMING CANON (must follow):
- Use `Request` for actions (types/structs/classes): e.g. SpeakRequest, LightSceneRequest.
- Use `run*` or `do*` for execution functions. Avoid the word `dispatch`.
- Use `select*` and `*Selector` for choosing logic.
- Use `Rules` for allow/priority/conflict checks.
- Use `Flags` for simultaneous conditions (bitmask), NOT `Mode` and NOT `State` unless it is truly progress/FSM.
- Replace vague container words: avoid Intent, Conduct, Context (as container), Orchestrator, Engine, Service, Strategy.
- Replace Store:
  - CRUD/collection/config -> `Catalog`
  - lookup/mapping/data table -> `Table`
- Avoid `Manager` for new names unless it truly manages resources/lifecycle.
  - Existing Manager names are allowed.
  - TimerManager and AudioManager are allowed exceptions.

REFACTOR SCOPE:
- Primary goal: naming/semantics cleanup (renames) with zero behavioral change unless explicitly asked.
- When you propose a change, use edit tools; do not paste full files or snippets in chat unless explicitly asked.
- Keep existing architecture, TimerManager usage, and current module boundaries. Do NOT add new modules.
- Do not introduce loops/ticks; timers must use TimerManager.
- Respect repo rules: use only isAudioBusy() and isSentencePlaying(); no new global audio state.
- If you detect a shortcut/patch outside architecture that might cause problems, STOP and ask me before changing it.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Give a short rename plan (ordered phases) + list of files touched.
- Then summarize changes and link to updated files.
