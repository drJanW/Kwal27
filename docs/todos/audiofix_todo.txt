AUDIO PREEMPTION — ARCHITECTURAL RECOVERY
============================================
Recovery from Copilot architecture violations introduced during earlier edits.

ROOT CAUSE (Copilot error)
--------------------------
PlaySentence (Controller layer) violates architecture in two ways:

1. Cross-subsystem call: playNextSpeakItem() calls PlayAudioFragment::stop()
   → Controller calling into unrelated Controller. Forbidden.
   Location: PlaySentence.cpp playNextSpeakItem() line 363

2. Policy decision in Controller: addTTS() checks isAudioBusy() before
   starting playback → Controller decides priority. That is Run/Policy work.
   Location: PlaySentence.cpp addTTS() line 510

SYMPTOM
-------
When a fragment is playing and cb_sayTime fires:
- addTTS() enqueues the TTS item
- wasEmpty=true but isAudioBusy()=true → playNextSpeakItem() never called
- Next addTTS() sees wasEmpty=false → also skips
- Items pile up → "Queue full, dropping" after 8 items
- No TTS plays until reboot

REQUIRED FIX
------------
1. RunManager (cb_sayTime): stop fragment before requesting TTS
   - cb_sayTime already owns the "speak preempts fragment" decision
   - Add: if (isFragmentPlaying()) PlayAudioFragment::stop(0);
   - Then call AudioPolicy::requestSentence() as before

2. PlaySentence: remove cross-subsystem call
   - playNextSpeakItem(): remove the isFragmentPlaying/stop block
   - Fragment is already stopped by RunManager before TTS is enqueued

3. PlaySentence addTTS(): remove isAudioBusy() guard
   - If wasEmpty → always call playNextSpeakItem()
   - PlaySentence is a dumb queue+player, no policy decisions
   - Same fix needed in addWords()

4. Verify: PlaySentence no longer includes PlayFragment.h
   - Remove cross-subsystem dependency entirely

FILES TO EDIT
-------------
- lib/RunManager/RunManager.cpp        (cb_sayTime: add fragment stop)
- lib/AudioManager/PlaySentence.cpp    (remove isAudioBusy guard, remove PlayAudioFragment::stop)
- lib/AudioManager/PlaySentence.cpp    (remove PlayFragment.h include if present)
