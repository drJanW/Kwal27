NAS Safe Push — Action Plan
============================
Status: COMPLETED (2026-02-20)

Goal: Push edited CSVs from SD to NAS without blocking WiFi/SSE/audio.

[x] 1. Health Check (Boot + Periodic)
   - After WiFi connects, probe NAS with a short-timeout HTTP GET /api/health.
   - Store result in status64 via setter/getter.
   - On fail: log once, set RGB alert color.
   - Repeat every 57 minutes (create once, repeat=0).
   - Implemented in NasBackup.cpp checkHealth() + WiFiBoot.cpp initial probe.

[x] 2. Upload (SD → NAS)
   - When a CSV is saved on SD, set pendingPatterns/pendingColors = true.
   - cb_pushToNas runs on a repeating timer (create once, repeat=0).
   - Implemented in NasBackup.cpp requestPush().

[x] 3. Download (NAS → SD)
   - Only on boot or manual "sync now" trigger.
   - SD is authoritative for local edits.
   - NAS is authoritative on manual sync.

[x] 4. csv_server.py
   - GET /api/health endpoint added.
   - POST /api/upload already exists with content-diff and history archiving.

[x] 5. No extra flags
   - Timer existence = "work in progress".
   - Pending bools = "what to push".
   - status64 bit = "NAS reachable" (set by health check).

[x] 6. Rules
   - Never block the main loop.
   - Never push while audio is playing or SD is busy.
   - Short HTTP timeout (1-2 seconds).
   - No self-rescheduling inside callbacks.
